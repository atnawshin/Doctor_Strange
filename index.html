            <h3>A Master of the Mystic Arts, Doctor Strange has phenomenally powerful magical abilities that enable him
                to skillfully conjure myriad spells.</h3>
            <p>From Marvel Studios comes “Doctor Strange,” the story of world-famous neurosurgeon Dr. Stephen Strange
                whose life changes forever after a horrific car accident robs him of the use of his hands. When
                traditional medicine fails him, he is forced to look for healing, and hope, in an unlikely place—a
                mysterious enclave known as Kamar-Taj. Before long Strange—armed with newly acquired magical powers—is
                forced to choose whether to return to his life of fortune and status or leave it all behind to defend
                the world as the most powerful sorcerer in existence.</p>
